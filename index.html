            <p>I graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2016 with a Bachelors in Digital Media Game Design. I'm currently a student at TES Coding Bootcamp for Web Design. I want to show you what I can do! Check out my portfolio while you're here. 
            </p>
            <p>I'm interested in all aspects of web design and I plan to become a full stack developer so I can help my clients achieve their dream website. A website is a window to the soul. Or almost as much anyway. I can work in groups or solo, and I love the collaborative process. I'm currently working with a team on designing a board game.
            </p>
            <p>I love travel, the coolest place I've been to is Japan. In my spare time I play video games, I make art, and I like exploring the nooks and crannies of Orlando!
